<h1>Post-Doctoral Positions for Provably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning</h2> 
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">
Multiple post-doctoral
research positions available in the project on "Provably Verified and
Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning," focused on developing formal
methods for AI techniques and also employ advances in AI techniques
for the development of formal methods. <br>
  
Broadly, the project is sub-divided into four major themes (detailed

</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
Theme 1: Revisiting NP Revolution: New Paradigms for SAT/SMT/MaxSAT Solvers<br><br>

Theme 2: Beyond NP Revolution: Constrained Sampling and 
Integration/Counting<br><br>

Theme 3: Verification of AI Systems<br><br>

Theme 4: Interpretable and Explainable Explanations for AI Systems<br><br>

<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">
We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; 
therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area 
and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, 
algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding are crucial to 
make a significant contribution to our research.

<h3>Job requirements:</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
1. A Ph.D. in CS or related disciplines such as ECE, Mathematics, and OR.<br>
2. Prior publications with deep algorithmic or system contribution in top-tier conferences <br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">

<h3>Procedure:</h3><br>
Interested candidates should
email <a href="mailto:meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg">meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
with a PDF of CV, which must contain information of at least two
references.  Furthermore, a short write up indicating your interest in
a particular theme is required. <br><br>

The initial term of appointment will be one year extensible for another 
year, upon review of satisfactory performance.<br><br>

The selected candidates will be offered competitive salaries and benefits.<br>
