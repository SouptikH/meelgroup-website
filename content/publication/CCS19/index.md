abstract: 'Neural networks are increasingly employed in safety-critical domains. This
  has prompted interest in verifying or certifying logically encoded properties of
  neural networks. Prior work has largely focused on checking existential properties,
  wherein the goal is to check whether there exists any input that violates a given
  property of interest. However, neural network training is a stochastic process,
  and many questions arising in their analysis require probabilistic and quantitative
  reasoning, i.e., estimating how many inputs satisfy a given property. To this end,
  our paper proposes a novel and principled framework to quantitative verification
  of logical properties specified over neural networks. Our framework is the first
  to provide PAC-style soundness guarantees, in that its quantitative estimates are
  within a controllable and bounded error from the true count. We instantiate our
  algorithmic framework by building a prototype tool called NPAQ that enables checking
  rich properties over binarized neural networks. We show how emerging security analyses
  can utilize our framework in 3 concrete point applications: quantifying robustness
  to adversarial inputs, efficacy of trojan attacks, and fairness/bias of given neural
  networks.'
