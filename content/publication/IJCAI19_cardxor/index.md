abstract: The runtime performance of modern SAT solvers is deeply connected to the
  phase transition behavior of CNF formulas. While CNF solving has witnessed significant
  runtime improvement over the past two decades, the same does not hold for several
  other classes such as the conjunction of cardinality and XOR constraints, denoted
  as CARD-XOR formulas. The problem of determining satisfiability of CARD-XOR formulas
  is a fundamental problem with wide variety of applications ranging from discrete
  integration in the field of artificial intelligence to maximum likelihood decoding
  in coding theory. The runtime behavior of random CARD-XOR formulas is unexplored
  in prior work. In this paper, we present the first rigorous empirical study to characterize
  the runtime behavior of 1-CARD-XOR formulas. We show empirical evidence of a surprising
  phase-transition that follows a non-linear tradeoff between CARD and XOR constraints.
