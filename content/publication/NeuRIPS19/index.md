abstract: In this work, we aim to leverage prior symbolic knowledge to improve the
  performance of deep models. We propose a graph embedding network that projects propositional
  formulae (and assignments) onto a manifold via an augmented Graph Convolutional
  Network (GCN). To generate semantically-faithful embeddings, we develop techniques
  to recognize node heterogeneity, and semantic regularization that incorporate structural
  constraints into the embedding. Experiments show that our approach improves the
  performance of models trained to perform entailment checking and visual relation
  prediction. Interestingly, we observe a connection between the tractability of the
  propositional theory representation and the ease of embedding. Future exploration
  of this connection may elucidate the relationship between knowledge compilation
  and vector representation learning.
