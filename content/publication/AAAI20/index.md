abstract: The success of MaxSAT (maximum satisfiability) solving in recent years has
  motivated researchers to apply MaxSAT solvers in diverse discrete combinatorial
  optimization problems. Group testing has been studied as a combinatorial optimization
  problem, where the goal is to find defective items among a set of items by performing
  sets of tests on items. In this paper, we propose a MaxSAT-based framework, called
  MGT, that solves group testing, in particular, the decoding phase of non-adaptive
  group testing. We extend this approach to the noisy variant of group testing, and
  propose a compact MaxSAT-based encoding that guarantees an optimal solution. Our
  extensive experimental results show that MGT can solve group testing instances of
  10000 items with 3% defectivity, which no prior work can handle to the best of our
  knowledge. Furthermore, MGT has better accuracy than the LP-based approach. We also
  discover an interesting phase transition behavior in the runtime, which reveals
  the easy-hard-easy nature of group testing.
