abstract: 'As engineered systems expand, become more interdependent, and operate in
  real-time, reliability assessment is indispensable to support investment and decision
  making. However, network reliability problems are known to be #P-complete, a computational
  complexity class largely believed to be intractable. The computational intractability
  of network reliability motivates our quest for reliable approximations. Based on
  their theoretical foundations, available methods can be grouped as follows: (i)
  exact or bounds, (ii) guarantee-less sampling, and (iii) probably approximately
  correct (PAC). Group (i) is well regarded due to its useful byproducts, but it does
  not scale in practice. Group (ii) scales well and verifies desirable properties,
  such as the bounded relative error, but it lacks error guarantees. Group (iii) is
  of great interest when precision and scalability are required, as it harbors computationally
  feasible approximation schemes with PAC-guarantees. We give a comprehensive review
  of classical methods before introducing modern techniques and our developments.
  We introduce K-RelNet, an extended counting-based estimation method that delivers
  PAC-guarantees for the K-terminal reliability problem. Then, we test methods'' performance
  using various benchmark systems. We highlight the range of application of algorithms
  and provide the foundation for future resilience engineering as it increasingly
  necessitates methods for uncertainty quantification in complex systems.'
