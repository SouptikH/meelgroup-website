title='<b>Paper on Sparse Hashing for Approximate Model counting accepted to <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics20/">LICS 2020</a>. Authors: S. Akshay and Kuldeep S. Meel </b><br>One of the reviews: "Rarely it is that there is a paper that proves a beautiful new theoretical result, explaining and simplifying previous work, and on top of that shows how it can be used to improve state-of-the-art practical algorithms. The paper "Sparse hashing for scalable approximate model counting: theory and practice" achieves exactly that."'
