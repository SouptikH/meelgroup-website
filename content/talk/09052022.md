title='<b>Our work on A Scalable Shannon Entropy Estimator is accepted to  <a href="http://i-cav.org/2022/">CAV-22</a>.</b> <br> We propose the first efficient algorithmic technique to estimate the Shannon entropy of a specification with PAC-style guarantees, i.e., the computed estimate is guaranteed to lie within a (1 ± ε)-factor of the ground truth with confidence at least 1−δ. <br>Authors:  Priyanka Golia, Brendan Juba, Kuldeep S.
