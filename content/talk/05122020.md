title = '<b>We will be presenting three papers at <a href="https://nips.cc/virtual/2020/public/cal_main.html">NeurIPS-20</a>.</b> <br>1. The [first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05378) focuses on efficient distance approximation in high dimension distributions. We propose an amazingly simple method that can compute L1 distance with rigorous guarantees. Come [Poster Session 5](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2020/public/poster_a8acc28734d4fe90ea24353d901ae678.html) on Thursday. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joint work with A. Bhattacharya, S. Gayen, and N.V. Vinodchandran <br>2. The [second paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12918) provides the first scalable method to test samplers in practice. Barbarik can now test samplers that sample from log-linear models. If you propose a sampling technique but can&apos;t prove its correctness, you can now use Barbarik to check its quality. Just the way we use testing for our software. ([Poster](https://t.co/zRZVsPZNka?amp=1)) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joint work with S. Chakraborty and Y. Pote <br>3. The [third paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10724) seeks to tame discrete integration with the boon of dimensionality (Yes, the boon not the curse). We extended our IJCAI-15&apos;s work of weighted to unweighted counting (thereby increasing the dimensionality) to handle rational weights.
