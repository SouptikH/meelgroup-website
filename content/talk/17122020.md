title='<b>Our paper on scalable quantitative verification for deep neural networks
has been accepted to ICSE-21.</b> <br>We give a sampling-based approach for quantifying
properties for deep neural networks and an attack-agnostic metric called
adversarial hardness to capture a model's robustness. Authors: Teodora Baluta,
Zheng Leong Chua, Kuldeep S. Meel and Prateek Saxena<br>'
