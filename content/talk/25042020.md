title = '<b>Two Papers accepted to <a href="https://sat2020.idea-researchlab.org/">SAT 2020</a>.</b> <br> 1. The first paper shows that the currently known bounds for sparse hashing are too weak to be used for algorithms such as ApproxMC. Authors: Durgesh Agarwal, Bhavishya and Kuldeep S. Meel <br> 2. The second paper proposes a new phase selection strategy for SAT solvers. Improving SAT solvers is just a very very hard job and we are excited about the improvements that our proposal brings to the world of SAT solving. Authors: Arijit Shaw and Kuldeep S. Meel'
