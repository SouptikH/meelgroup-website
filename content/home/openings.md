<font color="olive">We are always looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students, research assistants and summer internship for exceptional undergraduate interns in our group. We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding is crucial to make a significant contribution to our research.

<h2> Application Procedure: </h2>

<li> If you are a student at NUS, feel free to drop by 
Kuldeep's office or schedule a meeting with him. (See <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=meel%40comp.nus.edu.sg" target="_top">his calendar</a>). </li>

Furthermore, you should indicate your interest in a particular theme. For research themes look <a href="#research"> here</a>.</li>

<li> Internship (>=6 months): We strongly prefer candidates who want to use their internship as a way to apply for PhD programs (@NUS or elsewhere; of course, if you are good, we would like you to remain at NUS).

Make sure your subject contains the word "olleh" and you should include reviews of two of the papers published in the previous 3 years at AAAI/IJCAI/CP/SAT/CAV conferences. The reviews should be in the body of the email (and not as pdf). Furthermore, the body of your email should contain the phrase: "Here are two papers that I have reviewed". You should also provide reason for your choice of the papers. 
</li>

<li> Short term internship (=3 months): We may offer short term internship to exceptional undergraduates. It is up to you. </li>
 
<li> PhD positions: Admissions to School of Computing@NUS are handled via a central admission procedure: You can either apply via Department of Computer Science or the Institute of Data Science. </li>
